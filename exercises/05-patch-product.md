## Notes / Learnings
- **PATCH** updates only the fields you provide; the rest stay unchanged.
- **PUT** is technically meant for full replacements, but in DummyJSON it behaves like PATCH and leaves other fields unchanged as well.
- Always read API documentation to know whether to use **PUT** or **PATCH**.
- In real-world APIs, sending only part of the object with **PUT** might wipe out the missing fields â€” so be careful!
